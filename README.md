## Moving Forward

The election commission may consider that this script can provide election analysis that can identify important details of the population's voting tendency. It would be possible to apply this script to any election by fitting appropriate applicants, locations, and populations to the variables herein.

Furthermore, the script could be modified to show other interesting data such as counties with the least turnout, msot consistent turnout (over multiple elections).
